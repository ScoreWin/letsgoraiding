## Gameplay Loop
🔸 Start of turn:  
🔹 Regeneration occurs. (Default is 2 Energy and 1 Power)  
🔹 Abilities are drawn. (Default is 2)  
🔹 Cooldowns progress. (Abilities coming off cooldown are **Surfaced**)  

🔸 Main phase:  
🔹 Each hero may play 1 Ability in any order.  (**Combo** abilities do not count towards this limit)  

🔸 End of turn:  
🔹 Abilities are discarded.  
🔹 Fatigue occurs.  
🔹 Enemy Channeled abilities resolve.  

## Threat
LGR supports a simple positioning system that is a metaphor for threat.
When a hero plays an ability, threat is generated.
- **High Threat** abilities move the hero forward.
- **Low Threat** abilities move the hero backward.
- **Invert Threat** abilities move the hero to the opposite position.
- **Neutral Threat** abilities do not move the hero.

Enemies can only target heroes that are in front of other heroes. This gives opportunity to manage threat and have tanks absorb incoming abilities for squishy backliners.

If two heroes share the same threat, then the hero that generated threat next will move forward -- pushing the other to the low threat position.

**Knockback**, **Stealth**, and **Reach** are further ways of accessing the backline.

## Cooldowns
Heroes draw 2 abilities per turn. Abilities go on cooldown when they are played. The cooldown represents the number of turns that must pass before the ability is placed back on top of your deck. Players can progressively stack their rotations throughout the course of a game. These cooldowns are visible to all players, so it is possible to plan for when an enemy hero will draw an ability that has already been played.

## Ultimates
Ultimates are powerful, unique abilities that define a hero's playstyle. Heroes generate **1 Power** each turn. Power is typically required as a resource for playing and activating ultimates.

## Reserve
At the end of each turn, heroes discard their hand to the bottom of their deck. However, hero's can reserve an ability for a future turn by either right-clicking the ability. To access an already reserved ability, simply reserve a different one.

## Fatigue
Beginning at round 10, heroes start taking increasing damage at the start of the round (1, 2, 3, etc). This helps bring the game to a close as well as supports alternate win conditions from control-style decks.
